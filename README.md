# JMonkeyEngine

This gem will just include the [latest stable build](http://updates.jmonkeyengine.org/stable/3.0/engine/) source of jMonkeyEngine. That way your project won't need to include it because it's huge, and doing a `git push` with over 80mb of jar files takes a while when sitting at the airport.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jmonkeyengine'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jmonkeyengine

## Usage

1. Install the gem
2. View some [jruby examples](https://github.com/jwoertink/waves) or the [hello world tutorial](http://wiki.jmonkeyengine.org/doku.php/jme3#tutorials_for_beginners)
